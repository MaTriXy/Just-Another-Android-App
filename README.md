# Android Sample app with MVP architecture

Sample project that displays some images from the dribble API.
Demonstrates some cool stuff that you can do with the modern libraries and tooling in Android these days.

As someone said on reddit: "It's not over-engineered, it's just a skyscraper without the skyscraper part, just the foundations :)"
